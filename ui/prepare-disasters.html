				<h2 id="eq"> Earthquake </h2>
				<p> One of the most frightening and destructive phenomena of nature is a severe earthquake and its terrible aftereffects. Earthquakes strike suddenly, violently, and without warning at any time of the day or night. If an earthquake occurs in a populated area, it may cause many deaths and injuries and extensive property damage. </p>
				<ul>
				<li><b> Before </b>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Check for Hazards in the Home
						<li>Identify Safe Places Indoors and Outdoors
						<li>Educate Yourself and Family Members
						<li>Have Disaster Supplies on Hand
						<li>Develop an Emergency Communication Plan
						<li>Help Your Community Get Ready
					</p></ol>
				<li><b> During </b> <br><br>
					<i> Indoors </i>
					<ol><p>
						<li>DROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. If there isn't a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.
						<li>Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.
						<li>Stay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.
						<li>Use a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, load-bearing doorway.
						<li>Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.
						<li>Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.
						<li>DO NOT use the elevators.
					</p></ol>
					<i> Outdoors </i>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Stay there.
						<li>Move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.
						<li>Once in the open, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings, at exits, and alongside exterior walls. Many of the 120 fatalities from the 1933 Long Beach earthquake occurred when people ran outside of buildings only to be killed by falling debris from collapsing walls. Ground movement during an earthquake is seldom the direct cause of death or injury. Most earthquakerelated casualties result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects.
					</p></ol>
					<i> In moving vehicle </i>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.
						<li>Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake.
					</p></ol>
					<i> Trapped under debris </i>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Do not light a match.
						<li>Do not move about or kick up dust.
						<li>Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.
						<li>Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.
					</p></ol>
				<li><b>After</b>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Expect aftershocks. These secondary shockwaves are usually less violent than the main quake but can be strong enough to do additional damage to weakened structures and can occur in the first hours, days, weeks, or even months after the quake.
						<li>Listen to a battery-operated radio or television. Listen for the latest emergency information.
						<li>Use the telephone only for emergency calls.
						<li>Open cabinets cautiously. Beware of objects that can fall off shelves.
						<li>Stay away from damaged areas. Stay away unless your assistance has been specifically requested by police, fire, or relief organizations. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.
						<li>Be aware of possible tsunamis if you live in coastal areas. These are also known as seismic sea waves (mistakenly called "tidal waves"). When local authorities issue a tsunami warning, assume that a series of dangerous waves is on the way. Stay away from the beach.
						<li>Help injured or trapped persons. Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance such as infants, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Give first aid where appropriate. Do not move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger of further injury. Call for help.
						<li>Clean up spilled medicines, bleaches, gasoline or other flammable liquids immediately. Leave the area if you smell gas or fumes from other chemicals.
						<li>Inspect the entire length of chimneys for damage. Unnoticed damage could lead to a fire.
						<li>Inspect utilities: check for gas leaks, electrical system damage, or sewage and water lines damage.
						</p></ol>

				<h2 id="fl"> Flood </h2>
				<p> A flood is the rise of water in rivers, creeks, lakes, and other bodies of water which overflows to lower lying areas. This could result to destruction of property and loss of life.</p>
				<ul>
				<li><b> Before </b>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Avoid building or buying a home in a floodplain (unless you elevate and reinforce the building).
						<li>Elevate the furnace, water heater, and electric panel if home has been damaged by flood waters in the past.
						<li>Install "check valves" in sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up through the drains of your home.
						<li>Construct barriers (levees, beams, or floodwalls) to stop floodwater from entering your home. Seal walls in basements with waterproofing compounds to avoid leaks from outside.
					</p></ol>
				<li><b> During </b>
					<ol><p>
					<li>Listen to local radio stations, commercial radio, or television for information. Check the latest weather update <a href="http://www.typhoon2000.ph/">here</a> or <a href="http://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/">here</a> or call their 24-hour hotline at 433-ULAN (433-8526).
					<li>Be aware that flash flooding can occur. If there is any possibility of a flash flood, move immediately to higher ground. Do not wait for instructions to move.
					<li>Be aware of streams, drainage channels, canyons, and other areas known to flood suddenly. Flash floods can occur in these areas with or without warning when there are sudden, heavy downpours.
					<li>Do not walk through moving water. Six inches of moving water can make you fall. If you have to walk in water, walk where the water is not moving. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you.
					<li>Do not drive into flooded areas. If floodwaters rise around your car, you and your vehicle can be quickly swept away. If you can do so safely, abandon the vehicle and move to higher ground.
					</p></ol>
				<li><b>After</b>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Avoid floodwaters; water may be contaminated by oil, gasoline, or raw sewage. Water may also be electrically charged from underground or downed power lines.
						<li>Avoid moving water.
						<li>Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded. Roads may have weakened and could collapse under the weight of your vehicle.
						<li>Stay away from downed power lines, and report them to the power company.
						<li>Return home only when authorities indicate it is safe.
						<li>Stay out of any building, if it is surrounded by floodwaters.
						<li>Use extreme caution when entering buildings; there may be hidden damage, particularly in foundations.
						<li>Service damaged septic tanks, cesspools, pits, and leaching systems as soon as possible. Damaged sewage systems are serious health hazards. Clean and disinfect everything that got wet during the flood. Mud left from floodwater can contain sewage and chemicals. 
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h2 id="ss"> Storm Surge </h2>
				<p> A Storm Surge is an abnormal rise of water on the seashore caused by a low-pressure weather system. A storm surge brings widespread floods which can extend to kilometers from the seashore, depending on the shape and height of the wave. Along with strong waves and forceful winds, a storm surge can destroy and wash away anything in its path. </p>
				<ul>
				<li><b> Remember (as individuals): </b>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Listen and follow the officials; Follow weather updates from PAGASA ang other assisting government agencies via the radio, television, or internet.
						<li>Be ready for the possibility of evacuating to a more elevated area or evacuation center even before the storm surge happens. Always be calm and composed. Prepare and bring the following with you: clothes, food and water, first aid kit, flashlight, and battery-operated radio.
						<li>Evacuate to a more elevated place. Keep at least 500m distance from a flat coast if the storm will pass directly your area which will cause storm surge in your community.
						<li>Before evacuating, search the house and fix its weak parts. Tightly close the windows and turn off the electrical main switch. Place your important belongings to a high place. 
					</p></ol>
				<li><b> Remember (as part of community): </b>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Devise an evacuation plan; study all the aspects of disaster preparedness.
						<li>Conduct disaster drills for the members of your community that will instill familiarity to actual situations during times of calamity.
						<li>Have a precise and systematic procedure on collecting belongings, evacuation, guidelines of rescue operations, and other relief and rehabilitation actions.
					</p></ol>

				<h2 id="t"> Typhoon </h2>
				<p> A typhoon, or tropical cyclone, is a weather system characterized by a large low-pressure center and many thunderstorms, capable of producing strong winds and heavy rains. </p>
				<p> "Tropical" refers to the geographic origin of these storms, and their formation in maritime tropical air masses. "Cyclone" refers to the storms' cyclonic nature with counterclockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise rotation in the Southern Hemisphere. Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, such as hurricane, typhoon, tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, and simply cyclone. In the Philippines, the name of any tropical cyclone is bagyo. </p>
				<ul>
				<li><b> Preparation: </b>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Secure loose outdoor items around the home;
						<li>Fill vehicles and generator fuel tanks;
						<li>Check and charge all cell phones and emergency radios;
						<li>Make ice blocks;
						<li>Check and assemble flashlights, tools, and first aid kits;
						<li>Procure batteries, candles, matches, potable	water, canned or dry food, pet foods, medications,	etc.
					</p></ol>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h2 id="ve"> Volcanic Eruption </h2>
				<p>A volcano is a mountain that opens downward to a reservoir of molten rock below the surface of the earth. Unlike most mountains, which are pushed up from below, volcanoes are built up by an accumulation of their own eruptive products. When pressure from gases within the molten rock becomes too great, an eruption occurs. Eruptions can be quiet or explosive. There may be lava flows, flattened landscapes, poisonous gases, and flying rock and ash.</p>
				<ul>
				<li><b> Before </b>
					<ol><p>
						<li> Add a pair of goggles and a disposable breathing mask for each member of the family to your disaster supply kit.
						<li>Stay away from active volcano sites.
						<li>If you live near a known volcano, active or dormant, be ready to evacuate at a moment's notice.
					</p></ol>
				<li><b> During (near where you live) </b>
					<ol><p>
					<li>Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately from the volcano area to avoid flying debris, hot gases, lateral blast, and lava flow.
					<li>Be aware of mudflows. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge, and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching.
					<li>Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas. Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance: infants, elderly people, and people with disabilities.
					</p></ol>
				<li><b>After</b>
					<ol><p>
						<li>Listen to a battery-powered radio or television for the latest emergency information.
						<li>If you have a respiratory ailment, avoid contact with any amount of ash.
						<li>Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.
						<li>Use goggles and wear eyeglasses instead of contact lenses.
						<li>Use a dust mask or hold a damp cloth over your face to help with breathing.
						<li>Stay away from areas downwind from the volcano to avoid volcanic ash.
						<li>Stay indoors until the ash has settled unless there is a danger of the roof collapsing.
						<li>Close doors, windows, and all ventilation in the house (chimney vents, furnaces, air conditioners, fans, and other vents.)
						<li>Clear heavy ash from flat or low-pitched roofs and rain gutters.
						<li>Avoid running car or truck engines. Driving can stir up volcanic ash that can clog engines, damage moving parts, and stall vehicles.
						<li>Avoid driving in heavy ash fall unless absolutely required. If you have to drive, keep speed down to 35 MPH or slower.
